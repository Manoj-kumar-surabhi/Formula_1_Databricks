# Formula_1_Databricks
This project is based on my learning of Azure DataBricks.
I am going to create a Platform for Formula 1 Motorsport which supports data processing, Machine Learning and data scheduling. 

Step-1: I have created a resource group in Azure for this project named "databricks-ws2"
* In this resource group, I have included blob storage acccount, databricks and keyvault resources till now.

Step-2: I have created a cluster in DataBricks based on my student subscription.
